Repository for automated testing class

Second laboratory test scenarios:
1 Scenario:
Visit '[www.scrapthisite.com](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna)' website.
Try to login with incorrect data.
Log out what kind of error information website returned.

2 Scenario:
Visit '[https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://wbijam.pl)' website.
Scroll to chosen Anime (in this case 'Gleipnir')
Click on it
Confirm that it transfered you to appropiate subpage

I had to change a code (scenario2.py) a bit after deadline due to probable work on the Wbijam.pl website, which caused the tests and scenario steps that I had prepared on time to stop working, as a result of which I had to make a slight modification (mainly references to individual elements on the website) in order to make the tests work again and correctly implement scenario2 in cucumber structure
